Hoping to free \\nherself from debt, Teacher Mary took the initial step—\\nchanging her mindset. She advised others to do the same \\nby living within your means, planning before taking out a \\nloan, and prioritizing your needs over your wants.\\nWith her continuous hard work and perseverance, \\nTeacher Mary finally paid off her debts despite the \\nchallenging situation.33CASE STUDY: TEACHER MARY IS FINALLY DEBT-FREECHAPTER 4: ALL ABOUT CREDIT\\n34WHAT IS CREDIT?\\nIf you’ve ever taken out a loan or utang, you know what credit is. It is \\nwhen a borrower receives something of value now, usually cash, and \\nagrees to repay the lender back on a later date. Usually, the borrower \\nalso has to pay interest, or a percentage of the value they borrowed, \\nin addition to paying what they originally owe. For example, let’s say you’ve \\nalways dreamed of buying a \\nhouse. You do your best to \\nsave whatever money you \\ncan towards a fund to pay \\nfor the modest house of your \\ndreams. One day, you receive a \\nwell-paying job offer very close \\nto the neighborhood you’ve \\nalways envisioned your dream \\nhouse to be. You go around the \\nneighborhood and find a house \\navailable for sale. It’s perfect for your needs: \\nenough space for you and your \\nfamily and it’s within walking \\ndistance from your new, well-\\npaying job. You look at your \\nsavings fund and see that it \\nisn’t enough to buy this house, \\ndespite your best efforts. What \\ndo you do? This could be an \\ninstance when getting credit \\nor taking out a loan would be \\nbeneficial for you. From 5-6 to credit cards, credit or \\nutang is a familiar part of Filipino \\nculture. Credit can help you get \\nthrough financial emergencies \\nlike sudden hospital bills. It \\ncan also help you finance those \\nnecessary expenses that are too \\nexpensive to pay for without a \\nlittle help, like a car or a house.\\nIn the last chapter, we talked \\nabout how insurance was a way \\nof protecting yourself and your \\nfamily financially. \\nThink of credit as a different kind \\nof protection. When done for the \\nright reasons, loans ', 'can actually \\nhelp improve your financial \\nsituation and bring you closer \\nto living the life you’ve always \\ndreamed of.CHAPTER 4: ALL ABOUT CREDIT\\n35BORROWING MONEY AND TAKING ON DEBTS\\nIs borrowing money good or \\nbad? Well, it depends.\\nThere are situations where going \\ninto debt can be a step towards \\nyour own financial freedom. \\nExamples of this can be when you \\ntake out a loan to buy a home, a \\ncar, or to start a business. In these \\ncases, borrowing money could be \\ngood because you use the money \\nto your advantage. The new home \\nor car you buy can make a better-\\npaying job easily accessible, \\nputting you in a better financial situation than you were in before. \\nThe business you borrowed \\nmoney for can grow and earn you \\nmoney. This is what is known as a \\ngood debt.\\nBut be careful! Just as there are \\ngood debts, there can also be bad \\ndebts. Taking out a loan to pay \\nfor the cost of large, unnecessary \\nspending is a terrible reason to \\ngo into debt. When you borrow \\nmoney that you know you cannot \\npay back, you have acquired a \\ndebt that does not improve your financial condition. You may also \\nhave fallen into a debt trap. As \\nmuch as possible, avoid these \\nkinds of bad debts.\\nAs we can see, debts are not \\njust “good” or “bad.” But how \\nwill you know the difference? \\nKnowing the difference between \\na good debt and a bad debt \\nis very simple.

But the stock ex', 'change is only a \\nsmall part of the wider topic of investment. Simply put, \\nan investment is an asset or item acquired with the \\ngoal of generating income or appreciation. \\nIn other words, when you invest, you perform an action \\n(usually paying money or capital) in the hopes of raising \\nrevenue in the future.Now that you’ve learned how to \\ngrow your savings, how to secure \\nyourself and your family against \\nemergencies, and how to borrow \\nwisely, it’s now time to learn \\nhow to make your money work\\nfor you! \\nWhen people think about \\ninvestment, they usually think \\nabout rich investors who are experts in the ins and outs of a \\nstock exchange floor. But you \\ndon’t have to be a rich investor \\nto find financial success \\nthrough investing.\\nIn fact, investment products \\nnowadays are designed with \\nthe average Filipino in mind. \\nMany banks and businesses offer \\neasy and affordable investment products that allow you to \\nbegin investing. There are even \\nlegitimate mobile applications \\nthat allow you to invest through \\nyour cell phone. The possibilities \\nwith investing are almost endless. \\nAll you need is a little know-how \\nto begin your journey. CHAPTER 5: ALL ABOUT INVESTING \\n43WHAT IS THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN \\nSAVING VS. INSURANCE VS. INVESTMENT?\\nIn a previous chapter, we \\ndiscussed savings which is the \\nportion of your income you \\nchoose to set aside for many \\nreasons, including emergencies \\nor large expenses. Savings are \\nusually (but not always) placed \\nin a savings account and may be \\nwithdrawn at any time. Savings \\nare, essentially, money you \\nalready have that you are \\nkeeping for a rainy day.We’ve also discussed insurance. \\nAn insurance carries with it certain \\nbenefits that an investment \\ndoes not. Insurance policies are \\nusually exempt from estate taxes, \\nspecific to medical coverage, \\nand contain a clear procedure for \\ninheritance in case of unforeseen \\ncircumstances. This is because \\ninsurance policies are meant to \\nbe a means to secure yourself or \\nyour family against emergencies \\nor unforeseeable calamities. On the other hand, investments \\nare more of a means to grow \\nyour money.  Investments are, \\nat heart, profit-making activities \\nwhere you, the investor, part with \\nyour money in the hope that it will \\nmultiply. Think of it like entering \\ninto a business. You enter into a \\nbusiness in order to make your \\ninitial investment (or capital) \\nearn you more money (profits). \\nThe same goes for investments. \\nThe initial money you put into \\nthe investment product is your \\ncapital. Any money you earn from \\nit are your profits. \\nWHAT ARE THE KINDS OF INVESTMENTS?\\nIn general, there are two main types of investments: fixed income and variable income . Fixed income grows at a steady, predictable rate \\nover time. Variable income can gain and lose you money over time.\\nVariable income investments  are investments \\nwhere the growth of your capital can change \\nfrom one period to the next. These are usually \\nriskier investments. However, they have the \\npotential to earn you more money than fixed \\nincome investments. Fixed income investments are investments \\nwhere the money you receive will not change \\nfrom one period to the next. Your money grows \\nat a steady rate over time. These are more safe \\nand predictable investments. However, they \\nusually earn you less money than variable \\nincome investments.CHAPTER 5: ALL ABOUT INVESTING \\n44There is no “better investment” between \\nfixed or variable income. Which to invest in \\nall depends on your goals and risk profile.Given these definitions, which \\nkind of investment would you \\nprefer? Why? \\nAsk a friend or the person \\nseated beside you which type of \\ninvestment they prefer and why. \\nDo you have the same answer or a \\ndifferent answer?\\nChances are, your answer will \\nbe unique to you. Between fixed \\nincome and variable income \\ninvestments, there is no “better” \\ninvestment. Which investment \\nto take depends on your risk \\nappetite or profile. Some people \\nwould rather take the risk of \\na variable income if it means getting a higher payout at the \\nend of the day. They are known \\nas aggressive investors. Others \\nprefer the safety of a fixed income \\ninvestment even if it means \\ngetting a lower payout compared \\nto a variable income investment. \\nThese are conservative investors. \\nAgain, it all depends on what\\nyou prefer.\\nLet’s use an example. The \\nsimplest kind of fixed income \\ninvestment is the time deposit. \\nThe graph below will show you \\nthat in this kind of investment,\\nthe money you initially put in \\nmight not even have doubled \\nafter 30 years!PESOSFixed Income - Time Deposit\\nTime Deposit, 2% per year\\nNUMBER OF YEARS\\nAfter 30 years, your money doesn’t even double.

If you started investing \\nin 2006 in a pool of stocks that \\ninclude stocks from PLDT , Globe, \\nand Ayala Land for example, your \\ninvestment would have more than tripled in those 30 years. However, \\nthat growth isn’t consistent. There \\nwill be times when the value of \\nyour stocks will dip below the \\nvalue of the amount you originally \\ninvested. In this example, your \\nstocks lost value in 2008–2009.\\nVariable Income - Stocks\\nYEARS\\nInvesting in stocks is a waiting game.

The two most common are  the Ponzi \\nscheme and the pyramid scheme. IDENTIFYING AND \\nAVOIDING FINANCIAL \\nFRAUD AND SCAMS\\nA Ponzi scheme  is a scam \\nthat relies on the investments \\nmade by new investors to pay \\nearlier investors, making these \\npayments look like returns or \\nprofits from product sales. Ponzi \\nscammers promise high rates \\nof return with very little risk. \\nDon’t be fooled! Those returns \\nonly come from payments made \\nby newer investors like you. \\nThis means that you will only \\nsee a sizable return for your \\ninvestment if the scheme is able to recruit more people \\nafter you.  This is a very unstable \\nsystem and is likely to collapse \\nbefore you ever see the earnings \\npromised to you.\\nSimilar to the Ponzi scheme, \\na pyramid scheme  relies on \\npayments made by newer \\n“recruits” to pay older investors. \\nThis fact is usually hidden \\nbehind a “product” that \\nmembers must sell. But beware: This product is \\nusually worthless or difficult \\nto sell . \\nIn a pyramid scheme, your \\nreturns depend largely on how \\nmany people you are able to \\nrecruit into the scheme and how \\nmany people your recruits are, \\nin turn, able to recruit. Like the \\nPonzi scheme, this business is \\nvery unstable and is likely to fail \\nbefore you ever see returns on \\nyour investment.  Ponzi and pyramid schemes use money you pay as a new investor to pay earlier investors their “returns.” Models \\nlike this only benefit initial investors (who may also be involved in the scam) and will always collapse, leaving you \\nwithout any profit on your initial investment.CHAPTER 5: ALL ABOUT INVESTING \\n51To avoid Ponzi or pyramid schemes, consider the following questions before investing: \\nRemember that no legitimate businesses or investments \\nhave new recruits/investors as their main source of \\nfunds. If you find yourself in a situation where you are \\nbeing made to invest in such a business, don’t pursue it. \\nYou are most likely getting scammed.If the answer to any of these questions \\nis YES , you might be entering a \\npyramid scheme. Does the business you are investing in focus \\non recruitments or cash investments?\\nDoes it market products with little or no \\nreal value?\\nDoes it promise high interest or returns on \\ninvestment within a short period of time?\\nAre members compensated based on \\nnew recruits and downlines?Interactivity Portion! \\nClick on the checkboxes \\nthat apply to your \\nsituation!CHAPTER 5: ALL ABOUT INVESTING \\n52Here are some tips to avoid financial scams and frauds:\\n#1: Consider how \\nthe business you are \\ninvesting into makes \\nmoney.#2: Examine the \\npromise they are \\nmaking.#3: Do a quick Google \\nsearch.\\nDoes the business focus on Does the business focus on \\nrecruitments or cash investments? recruitments or cash investments? \\nDoes it market products with Does it market products with \\nlittle or no real value?

But the \\nonline space comes with its own \\nunique set of dangers—dangers \\nthat you must be familiar with \\nin order to protect your hard-\\nearned money. Common forms \\nof online scamming involve \\nscammers pretending to be your bank in order to obtain private \\ninformation from you (like your \\npassword or answers to your \\nsecurity tests). This can be done \\nover the phone or through email. \\nIt is important that you familiarize \\nyourself with your bank’s security \\nprotocols and learn how to spot \\nscammers posing as your bank.CHAPTER 5: ALL ABOUT INVESTING\\n53CHAPTER WRAP-UP!\\nASK!\\nInvesting can be exciting. \\nThis is where you can actually \\nmake your money work for you \\nand reap large benefits later. \\nHowever, be sure to only invest \\nin products and with businesses \\nyou fully understand. Do your \\nresearch. Ask any and all \\nquestions you can think of,\\neven if you feel dumb asking \\nthem. Remember that you \\nare possibly risking your \\nhard-earned cash. Legitimate \\ninvestment businesses \\nunderstand that people have\\nto be cautious about their \\nmoney and will gladly answer \\nyour questions. BE CURIOUS!\\nIt will also be wise to do your \\nown investigation. Check out \\n(legitimate!) internet sources \\non the type of investment you \\nare interested in. Ask a friend or \\nfamily member you trust who \\nis knowledgeable about the \\ntopic. Familiarize yourself with \\ninvestment terms and lingo so \\nthat you won’t be overwhelmed \\nor confused once you’re deep \\ninto considering where and \\nwith whom to invest. Ask banks \\nand reputable investment \\ncompanies for brochures on \\ntheir investment products. BE WISE!\\nLastly, invest only the money you \\nare prepared to lose. At the end \\nof the day, there is no guarantee \\nthat you will see the returns on \\nyour investment. That is the \\nreality that all investors deal \\nwith. Don’t let the promise of \\nlarge earnings distract you from \\nthis fact. If this is money you will \\nneed in the foreseeable future, \\nput it in a savings account.\\nAlso, be cautious of scammers \\nwho want to take your hard-\\nearned money. When investing or thinking about investing, always \\nremember three things: ask, be curious, and be wise.54You’ve successfully completed \\nthe financial wellness workshop. \\nCongratulations!
